# Project Title

This is the base theme template I start with when I start building a new custom theme for a Wordpress project. It's mobile-friendly and pretty design-agnostic/flexible so you're not pulled in one direction right off the bat design-wise. Supports search, posting and commenting, custom navigation menus, sidebar, widgets, and featured images. It's meant to be built on top of, it's by no means a finished product. Just a point of departure, hopefully a solid foundation on which to build a finished Wordpress theme. 

For the theme developer, it should be apparent where to substitute dynamic code for hard-coded placeholder images and copy. Bootstrap version is Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta.2, jQuery v1.11.1 (this is going to be updated soon)

This starter theme uses Flexslider 2 . It's already implemented, again just need to work your code into the hard-coded values in place for demo purposes. There are no external dependencies (unless you introduce them on your own).

### Prerequisites

Not much. If you know this is a starter Wordpress theme, it's likely you already have met the prerequisites and know what to do with the source.

### Installing

Just drop it in the /themes folder in your Wordpress installation and activate it. That's it!
